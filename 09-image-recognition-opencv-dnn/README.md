facescrub
=========

Download dataset from http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html

simply rum `python download.py`, all images are downloaded under `download`.

### Notice

Since I want to vertify the image and extract face region from the images, opencv-python package needed. If you are on Windows, this [url](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) can be very helpful to install packages.
